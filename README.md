# 2D-Geometry-Representation-Learning

This is the repository for our work on Two-Dimensional Geometry Representation Learning-Based Detection of Construction Workers' Activities with a Flexible IMU Solution.

Currently, only the model validation code is available. The dataset generation and model training code will be released soon.
